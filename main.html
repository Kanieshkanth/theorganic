    <h2>Organic farming</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an alternative agricultural system which originated early in the 20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices.
    Organic farming continues to be developed by various organic agriculture organizations today.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organic Farming is defined by the use of fertilizers of organic origin 
    such as compost manure, green manure,and bone meal and places emphasis on techniques such as crop rotation and companion planting.
    Biological pest control, mixed cropping and the fostering of insect predators are encouraged.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As per the definition of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) study team on organic farming “organic farming is a system which avoids or 
    largely excludes the use of synthetic inputs (such as fertilizers, pesticides, hormones, feed additives etc) and
    to the maximum extent feasible rely upon crop rotations, crop residues, animal manures, off-farm organic waste, mineral
    grade rock additives and biological system of nutrient mobilization and plant protection”.</p>
